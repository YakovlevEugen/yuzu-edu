    YOUR USE OF SITE By using or accessing the Site, you represent and warrant
    that you understand that there are inherent risks associated with virtual
    currency, and the underlying technologies including, without limitation,
    cryptography and blockchain, and you agree that Open Campus is not
    responsible for any losses or damages associated with these risks. You
    specifically acknowledge and agree that the Site facilitates your
    interaction with decentralized networks and technology and, as such, we have
    no control over any blockchain or virtual currencies and cannot and do not
    ensure that any of your interactions will be confirmed on the relevant
    blockchain and do not have the ability to effectuate any cancellation or
    modification requests regarding any of your interactions. 5.1 Without
    limiting the foregoing, you specifically understand and hereby represent
    your acknowledgment of the following: The Interface does not own or control
    any of the underlying software through which blockchain networks are formed,
    and therefore is not responsible for them and their operation. 5.2 In order
    to allow other users to have a full and positive experience of using the
    Interface you agree that you will not use the Interface in a manner that:
    Breaches the Terms; Seeks to interfere with or compromise the integrity,
    security, or proper functioning of any computer, server, network, personal
    device, or other information technology system, including, but not limited
    to, the deployment of viruses and denial of service attacks; Attempts, in
    any manner, to obtain the private key, password, account, or other security
    information from any other user, including such information about the
    digital wallet; Seeks to defraud us or any other person or entity,
    including, but not limited to, providing any false, inaccurate, or
    misleading information in order to unlawfully obtain the property of
    another; 5.3 You understand that smart contract protocols simply comprise a
    set of autonomous blockchain-based smart contracts deployed on the relevant
    blockchain network, operated directly by users calling functions on it
    (which allows them to interact with other users in a multi-party
    peer-to-peer manner). There is no further control by or interaction with the
    original entity which had deployed the smart contract, which entity solely
    functions as a provider of technical tools for users, and is not offering
    any sort of securities product or regulated service nor does it hold any
    user assets on custody. Any rewards earned by user interactions arise solely
    out of their involvement in the protocol by taking on the risk of
    interacting with other users and the ecosystem. 6. WEBSITE ACCURACY, THIRD
